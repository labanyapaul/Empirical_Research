Variables -

• Wealth variable: “Household wealth index in quantiles”. This shows the households wealth in 5 equal parts (sample divided into 5 equal sized groups). This index is constructed using data from surveys. It consists of labels to depict wealth categories - 1: poorest, 2: poorer, 3: middle, 4: richer, and 5: richest. There is also 8: missing, and 9:NIU (not in universe) labels but these are not included after data wrangling (drop NA's).

-   Landfill variable: This is shown through the size of the landfills throughout the years, originally in meters squared, but the unit of measurement used is hectares. For the landfill and city buffers and rings, the original unit of measurement was foot, but it has also been changed to hectares.

Sample period –

• We will examine the years 2008 and 2014 for the wealth variable. The total units of study consisted of 282,836 units, but after cleaning and wrangling; the treatment group consists of Kenya at 1,537 households and Ghana at 2,803 households. The control group consists of 2,408 households in Kenya and Ghana at 5,852. For landfill data, we will use satellite imagery between the years 2008 to 2014.

The wealth data sample may be unreliable due to limited surveys and a short sample period. Landfill data accuracy may also be affected by image quality issues on Google Earth Pro.

## Summary statistics

Figures 3. and 4. show the distribution of wealth index quintiles for Ghana in 2008 and 2014. The wealth index quintiles are divided into five categories: poorest, poorer, middle, richer, and richest. The histogram shows that the majority of households fall into the middle and poorer wealth quintiles, with fewer households in the richest and poorest quantiles.
