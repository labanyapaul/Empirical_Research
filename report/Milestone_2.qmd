# 2. The data set

## *Sources*

DHS Program – <https://dhsprogram.com/>

DHS IPUMS – <https://www.idhsdata.org/idhs/>

Google Earth Pro – <https://earth.google.com/intl/earth/versions/>

Variables -

• Wealth variable: “Household wealth index in quintiles”. This shows the households wealth in 5 equal parts (sample divided into 5 equal sized groups). This index is constructed using data from surveys.

Sample period –

• We will examine the years 2008 and 2014 due to limited variable data. For landfill data, we will analyze the years 2008 to 2014.

• The data sample may be unreliable due to limited surveys and a short sample period. Landfill data accuracy may also be affected by image quality issues on Google Earth Pro.

## *Table 1.*

## *Descriptive statistics*

The histogram shows the distribution of wealth index quintiles for Ghana in 2008 and 2014. The wealth index quintiles are divided into five categories: poorest, poorer, middle, richer, and richest. The histogram shows that the majority of households fall into the middle and poorer wealth quintiles, with fewer households in the richest and poorest quintiles.
