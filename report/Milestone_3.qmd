# 3. Econometric approach

Economic Model of Reference Taken from the Literature Reference Paper:
We reference the paper "Difference-in-Differences with a Continuous
Treatment" by Brantly Callaway, Andrew Goodman-Bacon, and Pedro H. C.
Santâ€™Anna. This paper provides an analytical framework for employing a
Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach in scenarios where the
treatment variable is continuous rather than binary. This framework is
highly relevant for our study, as we are investigating the impact of
varying degrees of exposure to landfills on household wealth in Ghana
and Kenya.

Relevance to our Paper: In our research, we aim to analyze the impact of
living near landfills on household wealth. The proximity to a landfill
serves as a continuous treatment variable, as the degree of exposure
varies with distance from the landfill. 



Econometric Approach:

overview:The econometric method used in this study is Ordinary Least Squares Fixed Effects Model.We specifically implemented Two Way Fixed Effects model to control for Individual and Time specific unobserved heterogeneity .

Model for Ghana:

For Ghana we employed TWFE model-
(i)Time Invariant Unobserved Heterogeneity(Individual Effects): Each landfill differs in characteristics like area,maintainence by government,surrounding population,etc. To control for this individual effects, we included landfill fixed effects in the model.

(ii)Time Specific Unobserved Heterogeneity:Our data encompasses two time periods 2008 and 2014 . Year fixed effects are included to control for variations specific to these time periods.

Model for Kenya:
For Kenya , due to lack of data, we could not implement the two way fixed effects model.We have data for the year 2014. We implemented fixed effect model. We included landfill fixed effects in the model to control for time invariant unobserved heterogeneity.

 Model specification:

 Main outcome Variable - Wealth Index
 Independent Variable- Treatment(Proximity to Landfill of the households) 
 Fixed Effects - 
 Landfill Fixed Effects
 Year Fixed Effects(only for Ghana)
 Control Variable - Head of the Household is a male.
   

The model is estimated using OLS regression. The coefficient of interest is the Treatment Variable(which indicates the households in the treatment group i.e living in close proximity to lanfills). The model is estimated separately for Ghana and Kenya to understand the impact of landfill proximity on household wealth in each country. Head of the household is male figure is used as the control variable, assuming that in a presence of a patriarch would affect the household income.The results are interpreted to provide insights into the economic implications of living near landfills in Sub-Saharan Africa.
