# 3. Econometric approach

Economic Model of Reference Taken from the Literature Reference Paper:
We reference the paper "Difference-in-Differences with a Continuous
Treatment" by Brantly Callaway, Andrew Goodman-Bacon, and Pedro H. C.
Santâ€™Anna. This paper provides an analytical framework for employing a
Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach in scenarios where the
treatment variable is continuous rather than binary. This framework is
highly relevant for our study, as we are investigating the impact of
varying degrees of exposure to landfills on household wealth in Ghana
and Kenya.

Relevance to our Paper: In our research, we aim to analyze the impact of
living near landfills on household wealth. The proximity to a landfill
serves as a continuous treatment variable, as the degree of exposure
varies with distance from the landfill. 


Econometric Approach: The econometric method used in here is OLS fixed effects model.We 
implemented Two way fixed effects model . The intuition behind this
model is to control for-
(1) time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity among the landfills(Individual effects). Every landfill is different from one another - they differ in area, population around it etc.To control for this individual effect, we include landfill fixed effects in the model. 
(2)Time specific unobserved heterogeneity- We have two time periods in our data 2008 and 2014 for Ghana. We include year fixed effects to control for this time specific unobserved heterogeneity. 

For Kenya , due to lack of data, we could not implement the two way fixed effect model.We have data for just 2014. We implemented one way fixed effect model. We included landfill fixed effects in the model to control for Time Invariant unobserved heterogeneity.

We used the following model specification for Ghana and Kenya:


Where: Main outcome Variable - Wealth Index
       Independent Variable- Treatment(Proximity to Landfill of the households) 
       Fixed Effects - Landfill Fixed Effects, Year Fixed Effects
       Control Variable - Head of the Household is a male.
   

The model is estimated using OLS regression. The coefficient of interest is the Treatment Variable(which indicates the households in the treatment group i.e living in close proximity to lanfills). The model is estimated separately for Ghana and Kenya to understand the impact of landfill proximity on household wealth in each country. Head of the household is male figure is used as the control variable, assuming that in a presence of a patriarch,household income would be more.The results are interpreted to provide insights into the economic implications of living near landfills in Sub-Saharan Africa.
