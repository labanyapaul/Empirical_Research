# 3. Econometric approach
Economic Model of Reference Taken from the Literature
Reference Paper:
We reference the paper "Difference-in-Differences with a Continuous Treatment" by Brantly Callaway, Andrew Goodman-Bacon, and Pedro H. C. Sant’Anna. This paper provides an analytical framework for employing a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach in scenarios where the treatment variable is continuous rather than binary. This framework is highly relevant for our study, as we are investigating the impact of varying degrees of exposure to landfills on household wealth in Ghana and Kenya.

Relevance to our Paper:
In our research, we aim to analyze the impact of living near landfills on household wealth. The proximity to a landfill serves as a continuous treatment variable, as the degree of exposure varies with distance from the landfill. The referenced paper's methodology is particularly suitable for our study due to the following reasons:

• Challenges with Continuous Treatment Variables:
	The authors discuss the difficulties in interpreting treatment effects across different levels of a continuous treatment due to potential selection bias. This insight is vital for our study, as households' proximity to landfills may not be randomly assigned, and factors influencing household location choice could confound our estimates.
• Alternative Estimation Procedures:
	The paper introduces alternative estimation methods that address the limitations of traditional linear two-way fixed-effects (TWFE) models. These methods can provide more reliable and interpretable estimates of treatment effects in the presence of continuous treatments, making them suitable for our analysis of the economic impact of landfill proximity on household wealth.
Application to our study
By utilizing the continuous treatment DiD approach from the referenced paper, our study will:
	Identify the causal impact of proximity to landfills on household wealth.
	Account for variations in treatment intensity (distance to landfill) across households.
	Mitigate potential selection bias through robust estimation techniques.

Study Setting:
	Countries: Ghana and Kenya
	Time Periods: 2008 to 2014
	Landfills: 6 major landfills across the two countries
Treatment and Control Groups:
	Treatment Group: Households within a 10 km radius of a landfill.
	Control Group: Households within a 10 km radius of a city center or main market area, not exposed to landfill effects.
Confounding/Control Variable:
	Patriarch Presence: Included as a control variable since households with a senior male figure might have a different wealth index compared to those without.

Model Specification
The regression equation to estimate the effect of landfill proximity on household wealth is:
〖Wealth〗_it= δ_s+∑_(t=2008)^2014▒〖γ_(t )  〗* 〖Year〗_t+β *〖Patriach〗_it+φ*(〖Treated〗_i*〖Year〗_t )+ϵ_it
where:
〖Wealth〗_it=Wealth index for household i in year t.
〖Year〗_t: Year dummy variables for each year from 2008 to 2014.
Patriarch=Control variable indicating the presence of a patriarch in the household.
Treated: Dummy variable indicating whether a household is within 10 km of a landfill (1 if treated, 0 if control).
ϕ: Coefficient on the interaction term, capturing the treatment effect.

Explanation
	Outcome Variable (Wealth Index): The main outcome of interest is the wealth index of households.
	Treatment Variable (Treated Dummy): _Treated is a binary variable representing whether a household is near a landfill (treated) or near a city center (control).
	Time Dummies (〖Year〗_t): Dummy variables for each year from 2008 to 2014, capturing year-specific effects.
	Interaction Term (Treated ×〖Year〗_t): This interaction term allows the treatment effect to vary over time, estimating whether the proximity to landfills has a differential impact on wealth in each year.
Expected outcome-
	We anticipate finding a positive effect on household wealth for those near landfills due to potential economic opportunities associated with landfill activities. The interaction terms will help determine whether this effect changes over time, providing insights into the long-term impacts of landfill proximity on household wealth.

Interpretation-

The coefficients on the interaction terms will indicate whether the effect of living near landfills on wealth changes across different years. A significant positive coefficient for a particular year would suggest that households near landfills experienced a greater increase in wealth in that year compared to those near city centers.
By adopting this methodology, we can systematically investigate the long-term effects of living near landfills on household wealth, accounting for variations in treatment intensities over a seven-year period. This approach ensures a rigorous analysis, offering valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders regarding the socioeconomic implications of landfill management.
