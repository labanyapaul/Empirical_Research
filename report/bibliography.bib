It also provides a brief assessment of their implementation in Nairobi and Mombasa, drawing on data from a 2016 community-based study. We found that SWM policies have evolved to specificity in terms of focus, functions and scope. There was a shift from criminalizing solid waste action or inaction to promoting good practices; from generic acts to specific ones; and from centralized mandates to more decentralized responsibilities. However, SWM remains a critical concern and a major challenge in Nairobi and Mombasa as a result of weak institutional structures and capacity, weak enforcement of regulatory frameworks, and the control of the sector by criminal cartels.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Across the globe, the livelihood of millions of people relies on the recovery and sale of valuable materials previously discarded as waste. In developed countries, this is mainly incorporated into the official recycling and resources recovery sector, while in developing countries the informal waste picking activities often make a major contribution. Waste picking provides important opportunities to people who have few or no marketable skills and education and no alternative sources of income to survive. However, waste pickers’ living conditions remain deplorable, and their working conditions continue to be dangerous due to hazardous waste. Given the social, economic, and environmental benefits waste pickers bring, and particularly their contribution to circular economy goals in developing nations, the role of waste pickers has mostly been undervalued on the development agenda. This paper examines the literature on waste pickers around the world, their working and living conditions, and explores the issue of formalisation. A total of 45 papers published from 1994 to 2022 were reviewed, covering case studies on waste pickers from 27 different countries. We analyse the content of these papers based on a list of key themes: poverty, health, stigma, environmental factors, informality, and formalisation. We find that the informal status of waste pickers, and the question of them being formalised into a Municipal Solid Waste Management sector is discussed extensively in the literature, and we delve deeper into this theme. Formalisation can potentially bring considerable improvement to the lives of waste pickers, including legal recognition, safe working conditions and fair bargaining mechanisms. In practice however, we find that formalisation policies take significantly different forms from one country to another and often fail to provide these benefits.},

	abstract = {The increase in urban growth in Ghana has in tandem seen an increase in waste generation which has a telling effect on the quantum of solid waste generated and disposed off. This study investigates the operational efficiency of the Tamale Landfill site. The descriptive cross-sectional study design was employed for this survey. Two areas were delineated for the study: residential houses within a 500-metre radius of the landfill site and areas more than 500 metres away. The purposive and simple random sampling techniques were used to select 384 households, 16 scavengers and some key respondents for the study. The results of the study reveal that a majority (98.4\%) of respondents and scavengers (100\%) from the nearby community complain about the proximity of the facility to their residences which generates odour, breeds predators and insects, dust, litter and smoke. Some of the problems which also impede the smooth operation of the facility are inadequate funding, lack of key personnel, and a non-functional weighbridge. These problems lead to infrequent covering of waste which in effect creates litter, dust, odour and generates leachate as well as disease carrying vectors. Hospital waste is also not well managed on site. The study concludes that solid waste at the Tamale Landfill site is not well managed thereby creating poor conditions which generate a lot of nuisances ranging from choking smoke, putrefying odour, dust, leachate, litter, easy access, poor management of hospital waste and breeding places for insects and other pests. The repercussions are the high incidence of malaria, diarrhoea, respiratory diseases, skin diseases, still births and animal bites. Hence, considering that the Wuvugumani and Gbalahi communities are found within 500 metres of the landfill, the Tamale Landfill Site should be relocated because of its negative environmental and health effects on the lives of people in the nearby communities.},

	abstract = {Background and aim
              The implementation of idoneous management of hazardous waste, in contrast to illegal practices, is one of the environment and health priorities of the WHO. The aim of the present study, based on a collaborative agreement between the Italian National Health Institute and a Prosecution Office located in Naples North, was to evaluate the health effects of illegal landfills and burning of urban and hazardous waste in the territory of the Prosecution Office.
            
            
              Methods
              The municipalities included in the study territory were investigated with respect to the regional population. Regression analyses were performed in the study area between four classes of an environmental municipal indicator of waste risk (MRI) previously defined, computing the relative risks (RRs) in 2–4 MRI classes, with respect to the first MRI class (the least impacted). The prevalence of reproductive outcomes and cause-specific mortality and hospitalization were analyzed in the general population and in the 0–19-year-old population using SAS software.
            
            
              Results
              An increase of mortality and hospitalization risk in both the genders of the whole area, with respect to regional population, were found for overall all cancer cases, cancer of the stomach, the liver, the lung and the kidney, and ischemic heart diseases. An increase of mortality for leukemias in the 0-19-year-old population and in hospitalization risk for certain conditions originating in the perinatal period were observed. Correlation between MRI and the risk of mortality from breast tumors in women (MRI class 2: RR = 1.06; MRI class 3: RR = 1.15; MRI class 4: RR = 1.11) and between MRI and the risk of hospitalization from testis tumors (MRI class 2: RR = 1.25; MRI class 3: RR = 1.31; MRI class 4: RR = 1.32) were found. The hospitalization risk from breast tumors and asthma exceeded significantly in both genders of three and four MRI classes. Among the 0-19-year-old population, correlation between MRI and hospitalization from leukemias (MRI class 2: RR = 1.48; MRI class 3: RR = 1.60; MRI class 4: RR = 1.41) and between MRI and the prevalence of preterm birth (MRI class 2: RR = 1.17; MRI class 3: RR = 1.08; MRI class 4: RR = 1.25) were found.
            
            
              Conclusion
              A correlation between health outcomes and the environmental pressure by uncontrolled waste sites was found. Notwithstanding the limitation of the study, the results promote implementing the actions of environmental remediation and the prosecution of illegal practices.},
