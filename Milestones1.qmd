# 1. Research Proposal

## Motivation

The staggering reality of over 15 million individuals inhabiting garbage dump communities globally, though likely an under reported figure, highlights a pressing concern. This number is not static; it's
steadily increasing. Alarmingly, a significant portion of this population, conservatively estimated at
two-thirds, resides in the sub-Saharan Africa region alone. The well-being of these individuals,
teetering on the edge of poverty, demands urgent attention. When we speak of well-being in this
context, we refer primarily to two fundamental facets: health and income. We want to understand
how living near landfills affects communities. These environments, often synonymous with
destitution and neglect. By studying this, we hope to help these communities by understanding and
finding ways to make their lives better through future policy making.

## Research question

How does proximity to landfills impact the health and income of people living in Ghana and Kenya?

## Literature overview

Existing scientific research investigates the relationship between health effects and income opportunities among populations residing near landfills (Fazzo et al., 2023). Previous studies in Kenya
and Ghana have explored the health and environmental impacts of landfill proximity, as well as
initiatives aimed at formalizing waste picker activities and proposing solid waste management
strategies (Oteng-Ababio, 2014; Lissah et al., 2020; Adzawla et al., 2019; Obiri-Nyarko et al., 2021;
Kaluli et al., 2011). However, none have specifically addressed the relative strength of the impact
between health and income for individuals near these sites.
In the case of Kenya, Wekisa et al. (2020) conducted a study titled "Spatial distribution of waste
collection points and their implications on quality of life in Mombasa County, Kenya," aiming to
elucidate the relationship between proximity to garbage collection points/landfills and the Quality of
Life Index. Employing Pearson correlation coefficient analysis, the research revealed a noteworthy
positive correlation between income levels and proximity to landfills. However, this correlation came
at a cost: increased exposure to diseases and a decline in air quality were observed as consequences
of such proximity.

In a similar context, Dr. Simon K. Kimani's research delved into the impact of pollutant exposure on the health of women waste pickers at Dandora Dumpsite in Nairobi, Kenya. Utilizing a questionnaire-
based data collection method and a cross-sectional study design, the investigation aimed to assess the health status of female landfill workers in Dandora. The findings were alarming, indicating that a
staggering 90.8% of the female waste pickers had experienced illness within the past six months.
Further contributing to the understanding of waste management's socio-economic ramifications,
Vincenzio Manyah Wangatia's study, "The Influence of Solid Waste Management Practices on
Socioeconomic Lives of Residents of Dandora," focused on households living near the Dandora
dumpsite. Through questionnaire surveys involving 121 households, the research examined two key
variables: income from solid waste management and household expenditure. Descriptive and
correlation analyses unveiled a substantial finding: the total income derived from solid waste
management contributed a significant 82.88% towards the total household expenditure. Moreover, a
statistically significant correlation (r=0.389, p=0.01) underscored the interplay between income generated from waste management activities and household financial stability. These collective
insights underscore the complex trade-offs between income generation and health risks faced by
individuals engaged in landfill work.

In the context of Ghana, Obiri- Nyarko et al. 2021 collected soil samples from various zones in the
Kpone landfill site to investigate key variables: the quantity and spatial distribution of heavy metals
and their effects on health risks and agricultural suitability. The investigation using AAS (Atomic
Absorption Spectrophotometry) to identify arsenic, copper, zinc, lead, and mercury in landfill soil
revealed that while low concentrations of these metals may not pose immediate harm to humans,
prolonged and direct exposure to elevated levels presents significant health risks. Specifically, even at low concentrations, arsenic and lead exhibit adverse effects on both the environment and human
health. Particularly vulnerable are children, for whom ingestion of substances from these landfills
constitutes almost all the associated risk (99.31%). Analysis indicates that pathways to carcinogenic
health hazards primarily involve ingestion and dermal contact, with inhalation being the least
significant. Notably, the relatively high concentration of arsenic in the soils contributes significantly to elevated cancer risks, reaching 99.9% in adults. In a separate investigation conducted by Lettor (2018), the study examined the health implications of waste management operations at the Tamale landfill. The research encompassed residential areas within a five-hundred-meter radius of the landfill site in Tamale. Sample collection procedures were randomized, and data were gathered through
interviews, focus groups, and questionnaires. The findings revealed that over 90% of individuals near
the landfill experienced odours, contrasting with only 2% reported further than five-hundred-meters
away. Moreover, the study identified improper waste disposal practices leading to contamination of
groundwater and surface waters. It was evident from the results that inadequate management and
failure to adhere to international standards expose nearby residents to various diseases and
contaminants. 

Mensah and Nalumu (2023) investigated the motivations and challenges of informal sector workers in the context of income generation. Employing a mixed-method approach involving interviews and
questionnaires, the researchers utilized statistical analysis tools such as SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences), followed by Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Relative Importance Index
(RII), to discern patterns and draw conclusions. Their findings suggest that waste pickers may
prioritize immediate financial gain over their health due to economic necessity, as evidenced by their
willingness to endure short-term and long-term health risks associated with landfill work. This
highlights the primacy of survival considerations in shaping the decision-making of informal sector
workers. In a study conducted by Owusu-Sekyere (2018), the effects of landfills in Kumasi on
economic development were examined. The research used focus groups and in-depth interviews
involving stakeholders such as public health departments, employment desks, waste management
departments, environmental sanitation offices, as well as households and informal workers. The
findings revealed several positive economic impacts associated with landfills, including benefits
accruing to waste pickers through the collection of recyclable materials (such as plastics, metals
including copper, gold, and silver, and glass), farmers benefiting from cultivatable areas, and
homeowners experiencing appreciation in property values due to the construction of access roads for
the landfill area. Notably, 90% of respondents reported a positive impact on land value. These
findings underscore the role of landfills in job creation and their potential contribution to poverty
alleviation within nearby communities, where monetary considerations often outweigh health risks.

## Data Description

We utilize georeferenced data obtained from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for Ghana and Kenya, employing secondary data sourced from DHS databases. The dataset is structured at the
household level, collected via questionnaires administered to household members. Categorical
variables such as 'Adult had illness recently' serve as indicators of health status, while
wealth index data is utilized as a proxy for household income levels.
To map out where the landfills are and how they've changed over time, we use images from Google
Earth Pro covering about 10 years, from 2014 to 2024. Landfills that are worked on -  

(i) Kenya- Dandora Dumpsite, Gioto dumpsite ,Kisumu Municipal garbage site, Mwakirunge dumpsite,
Kayole, Nyeri, Accra, Thika dumpsite,Kiteezi Landfill and Maputo city landfill.

(ii) Ghana- Agbobloshie (Kpone) landfill, Oti landfill, Gbalahi landfill, Sofokrom landfill, Pantang Borla dumpsite, Awutu Senya dumpsite landfill, Nkanfoa landfill, Sherigu Bolgatanga dumpsite, Wa landfill, Mallam landfill.

## Empirical Strategy

In our study, the treatment group comprises households living within a 10 km radius of a landfill, while the control group consists of households within a 10 km radius of the city center or main market area. One potential bias we've identified stems from variations in landfill types across Ghana and Kenya. Some landfills are government-maintained and engineered according to specific protocols, while others are informal dumping sites, often termed "illegal," which fail to meet standard regulations and have a more detrimental impact on nearby communities.

To address this variation, we will employ a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) model with a continuous treatment variable. This type of model is useful in cases where treatment is not simply a matter of being treated or not but can be received to different extents. This approach extends the traditional DiD model, which typically uses a binary treatment indicator, to account for varying treatment intensities. This is important in our context because not all landfills are comparable, and the extent of their impact on surrounding households can differ significantly.

We would like to show that treatment effect on the treated-type parameters can be identified under a generalized parallel trends assumption similar to the binary treatment setup. However, interpreting differences in these parameters across different values of the treatment can be particularly challenging due to selection bias that is not ruled out by the parallel trends assumption. We would ultimately like to provide treatment effect decomposition results, highlighting the parameters associated with popular linear two-way fixed-effect (TWFE) specifications over the time periods.

Using this methodology, we aim to investigate the long-term effects on the income and health of individuals residing near landfills. We expect to find a positive effect on income levels, due to potential economic opportunities associated with landfills, but a negative impact on health, due to exposure to landfill-related hazards.
