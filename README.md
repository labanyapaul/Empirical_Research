# Input 
- Landfill data (.kmz files) are saved under /Ghana or Kenya/Landfills. 
- City data is saved under /input/world_2015_20000.gpkg

# Landfill Polygons
- As we did not have enough information in some landfills due to missing satellite imagery/ missing years. We have taken the year before and replicated it for the year after (missing imagery), and for the other years which are also missing.
