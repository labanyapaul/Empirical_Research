This is to show where some of the data has been saved and to follow along on important steps. Some data which is sensitive and is on gitignore. will be commented on here. 

# Input 
- Landfill data (.kmz files) are saved under /Ghana or Kenya/Landfills. 
- City data is saved under /input/world_2015_20000.gpkg
- GPS files are saved under /input/GHGE71FL_2014 and GHGE5AFL_2008. Within these files we have used the corresponding .shp files and intersected with the landfill polygon data. (Ghana can be found under all_landfills_polygon.csv in the 3. analysis folder.)

# Landfill Polygons
- As we did not have enough information in some landfills due to missing satellite imagery/ missing years. We have taken the year before and replicated it for the year after (missing imagery), and for the other years which are also missing.
